            <h1>Commercial & Domestic Tiling services</h1>
            <p>Our company was founded in the early 1800s by Eric Raytheon and produced traditional tiles and flooring. In the 1950s, we began producing more contemporary designs and in the 1970s, we became one of the leading producers of ceramic tiles. In the 1990s, the company got acquired by the Pierce & Pierce Investment Fund. Today, our company is one of the largest tiling companies in North America. </p>
            <p>Retiling your bathroom is a great way to give it a fresh, modern look. It can also help to protect your walls from water damage and mold, and can even increase the value of your home. Plus, with so many different styles and colors of tile available, you can create a unique look that reflects your personal style. </p>
            <p> We can help you retile your bathroom by providing the necessary materials, tools, and expertise to complete the job.

            <p>We offer the most exclusive forms and methods of tiling, that includes hand-painted tiles, encaustic tiles, mosaic tiles, and glass tiles. Hand-painted tiles are made from ceramic or porcelain and feature intricate custom designs that are painted by hand. Encaustic tiles are made from clay and feature a pattern that is created by pressing colored clay into a mold. Mosaic tiles are made from small pieces. </p>
